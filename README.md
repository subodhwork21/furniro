# Furniro

**Furniro** is an e-commerce application designed for desktop users to provide a seamless online shopping experience for furniture enthusiasts. It allows customers to browse products, search, add items to the cart, and complete purchases through a smooth checkout process. The platform is tailored to meet the needs of both customers and administrators, offering robust functionality and a user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

In this project, I was responsible for handling the entire coding process using **Payload**, a powerful CMS framework. While the design was imported from an external source, I integrated it into the application and developed all necessary functionalities, from product browsing to checkout. The result is a functional and easy-to-navigate platform built specifically for desktop users.



### Design Reference

The design used in this project was sourced from a publicly available Figma file and does not belong to me.
