# Furniro

**Furniro** is an e-commerce application designed for desktop users to provide a seamless online shopping experience for furniture enthusiasts. It allows customers to browse products, search, add items to the cart, and complete purchases through a smooth checkout process. The platform is tailored to meet the needs of both customers and administrators, offering robust functionality and a user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

In this project, I was responsible for handling the entire coding process using **Payload**, a powerful CMS framework. While the design was imported from an external source, I integrated it into the application and developed all necessary functionalities, from product browsing to checkout. The result is a functional and easy-to-navigate platform built specifically for desktop users.

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Users can explore a variety of furniture products.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar enables users to quickly find the items they need.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to the cart and review them before purchasing.
- **Checkout Process**: Fully functional checkout with smooth transaction handling.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage products, orders, and customer information easily.

## Technologies Used

- **Payload CMS**: For managing the backend logic, data models, and content.
- **HTML & CSS**: Front-end development for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and enhance the user experience.
- **MongoDB**: Database management for storing product, order, and customer data.
